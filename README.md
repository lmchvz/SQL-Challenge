## SQL Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

### Project Description: 
The objective of this challenge is to design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data by perforing the following steps: 
* 1. 'Data Modeling': Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables using the tool QuickDBD [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com]
* 2. Data Engineering : Use the data to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files; Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
* 3. Data Analysis
1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
2. List employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
